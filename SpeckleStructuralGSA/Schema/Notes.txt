This folder will be the new location for classes that represent the GSA schema.  The idea behind this is to separate:
- the textual parsing of GWA commands into meaningful typed values
- the logic of converting these typed values to/from Speckle-typed objects

These classes are essentially a dictionary representation of the GWA values and should only deviate from this concept for these situations:
1. A C# type can't represent the full range of values of a GWA parameter without using dynamic.  
For example: in LOAD_NODE commands, the same GWA parameter can store the string "GLOBAL" (essentially marking it as using the global 
axis/coordinates and not referencing any particular entry in the AXIS table) or an integer index of a record in the axis table.  
In this case, two class members (a bool and a nullable integer) are mapped to this one GWA parameter.
